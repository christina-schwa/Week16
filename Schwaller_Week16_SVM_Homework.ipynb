    "Researching jobs online, I found several that appealed to me. An organization called Love Justice International has a program to combat human trafficking, and they currently are advertising a data science position. That position requires a Masters degree, though. I also looked at data analyst positions because there seem to be more entry-level positions of this type. The Mayo Clinic and several other healthcare organizations are looking for data scientists and/or data analysts to work on predicting clinical outcomes for patients based on various factors, including treatment plans. The Center for Employment Opportunities is an organization that provides career resources to formerly incarcerated people, and they are in need of a data and contracts analyst. The Voter Participation Center focuses on registering and mobilizing underrepresented groups, who together make up the majority of potential voters but are currently underrepresented in politics, to vote. The CDC is also looking for a data analyst to look at participation rates in the Covid vaccination program. An organization called MITRE is looking for a climate health data scientist.\n",

It appears that they may be looking primarily for volunteers right now, but this could still be a good opportunity to build experience and participate in projects that would build out my resume and qualify me for more and better data science jobs. DataKind has had recent projects related to identifying food bank dependency, finding paths out of homelessness, empowering women, revitalizing communities through environmental cleanup, and uncovering corruption. One project that looked particularly interesting was \"Using Time Series Forecasting to Improve Access to Safe Sanitation.\" This is also a major focus of the World Bank (I do copyediting work for them), but I did not find any current data job postings on their website."
